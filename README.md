## About this Repository

### What does the Repository contain?

It has the [CSV file](data/list_qaops.csv) with the list of qAOP models published in the scientific literature by 2022 and the results of their evaluation. 
<br>
The qAOP models were assessed for nine key features: type of stressor(s), species, causal structure, assay, input data, methodology, output information, application, and accessibility.
